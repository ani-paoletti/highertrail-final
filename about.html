		<div id="story"><p> <div id="oneforone">One for One Mission </div><br> Higher Trail is a charitable clothing brand, which provides creative products to solve problems in Minnesota.
			The mission of Higher Trail is to warm the hands and hearts of everyone. For one pair purchased of our mittens, one pair will be directly donated to the homeless. We believe that every child and adult in Minnesota should have warm hands while they're in the great outdoors.  The donations are delivered to homeless shelters and schools in the Twin Cities area.
			On any given day, at least 4000 children (aged 16 and younger) experience being homeless in Minnesota. Their families are working hard in order to meet their families needs, which makes it difficult to purchase something simple like a pair of mittens. Higher Trail established its roots in solving clothing problems for those who need it the most. Through partnerships with homeless shelters, we established a precise donation process to ensure the homeless receive our mittens.
			Our mission strives to connect you with those in need through our One for One donation program. This connection is empowering as you are reminded of your charitable donation every time you wear our mittens.</p></div>
			<div id="made"><p> <div id="mission">Made in Minnesota </div><br> To empower our customers and the homeless, it's key to provide them with positive elements from within their communities. Our Blue Mittens are all crafted to perfection in Duluth, MN, making it an authentic "Made in Minnesota" item. <br> <br> <div id="our"> Our Story </div> <br> Our vision was to capture people's general "help your neighbor" mentality and turn that into a creative mission to improve Minnesota.
			We believe that the higher trail is the immeasurable progress each of us attain by improving ourselves and the world around us. It is more than one or two goals, it's a lifelong pursuit towards the best you can be.
			The blue arrows above the letter "i" in both words of Higher Trail represent progress, empowerment, and trust. These arrows point up to encourage progress for all. When the two arrows are stacked on top of each other it symbolizes "a bright prospect" found nested in the history and traditions of the United States.</p></div>
